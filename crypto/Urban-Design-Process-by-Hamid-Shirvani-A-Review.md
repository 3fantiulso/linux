The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the concept and scope of urban design, its history and evolution, and its relationship to other disciplines such as architecture, planning, landscape architecture, and urban studies. Part II presents the analytical tools and methods for understanding the physical, social, economic, and environmental aspects of urban spaces. Part III discusses the creative and critical aspects of urban design, such as generating alternatives, selecting criteria, testing solutions, and communicating results. Part IV showcases examples of urban design projects from various countries and regions, such as Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
 
The book is intended for students, educators, practitioners, and researchers in the field of urban design, as well as anyone interested in the art and science of shaping the built environment. The book is written in a clear and accessible language, with diagrams, photographs, maps, tables, and charts to illustrate the concepts and examples. The book also provides references, bibliographies, glossaries, and indexes for further reading and research.
 
Urban Design Process is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the theory and practice of urban design. The book offers a comprehensive and systematic framework for understanding and applying urban design principles and processes to various contexts and situations. The book also demonstrates the diversity and richness of urban design as a discipline and a profession that can contribute to the quality of life in cities.
  
One of the main strengths of the book is its holistic and interdisciplinary approach to urban design. The book recognizes that urban design is not only a matter of aesthetics, but also of functionality, sustainability, and livability. The book also acknowledges that urban design is not a static or isolated activity, but a dynamic and collaborative one that involves multiple stakeholders and disciplines. The book encourages the readers to think critically and creatively about urban design problems and solutions, and to consider the impacts and implications of their decisions on the urban environment and its inhabitants.
 
Another strength of the book is its global and comparative perspective on urban design. The book exposes the readers to a variety of urban design projects from different parts of the world, highlighting the similarities and differences in their contexts, objectives, challenges, and outcomes. The book also provides insights into the cultural, social, political, and economic factors that influence urban design practices and preferences in different regions and countries. The book helps the readers to appreciate the diversity and complexity of urban design as a global phenomenon that reflects and affects local realities and aspirations.
 
A possible limitation of the book is its lack of focus on some emerging issues and trends in urban design, such as digital technologies, smart cities, participatory design, resilience, and social justice. The book does not address how these issues and trends affect or challenge the existing theories and methods of urban design, or how they create new opportunities and possibilities for urban design innovation and experimentation. The book could benefit from incorporating more recent examples and discussions of urban design projects that respond to these issues and trends, or that propose alternative or radical visions for the future of cities.
